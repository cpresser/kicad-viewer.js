# kicad-viewer.js

A browser based viewer for KiCad files (.kicad_mod files only for now)

This is only a experiment. Don't expect anything for now.

A similar project can be found here: [luxferresum/kicad.js](https://github.com/luxferresum/kicad.js). Was not able to
get it running and will try my own HTML canavas experiments therefore :).
(and it was not able to build with current coffescript).
